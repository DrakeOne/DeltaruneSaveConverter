# DeltaruneSaveConverter

A C#.NET command line tool to convert DELTARUNE Chapter 1 save files between PC and console editions of the game. This tool can also, in theory, be used to extract and pack UNDERTALE save files between consoles.

This program is a work in progress and may not work in all situations - this has only been tested converting 1 file from the Nintendo Switch version of DELTARUNE to the PC version and back.

## Web Version

## TODO

(in no particular order)

- Test conversion between PS4 and PC
- Initial DELTARUNE Chapter 2 support
- Friendlier user interface (+ GUI edition?)
- Probably more idk, suggestions and contributions welcomed.
- Far future/another project, make this into a multitool?
	- Merging save files from both platforms into one seamlessly
    - Parsing of UNDERTALE save files
    - Save file editing
